<h3>Reflecting on my Learning</h3>
<h6>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h6> 
<p>I want to be a developer, I want to create software that helps people, improve's their lives and contributes positively to society. I want to be continuously learning and growing and pushing myself.</p>
<p>Upon finishing and Dev Acadey, I hope to obtain a junior position in a development team at a company whose values align with mine, who are doing something meaninful.
I want to continuously progress in my own learning while mentoring others. I want to always have my own projects on the go, building software that empowers people.

<h6>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
</h6>
<p>My strengths will be my ability to focus and to work hard. My limitations will be my energy management and time management.</p>
<p><i>" My strengths lie in analysis, problem-solving, articulating and processing. I can think about the big picture and get lost in fine details, doing these things simultaneously can be difficult though."</i></p>
<p>I think these are still my main strengths, I am also good at persivering.</p>
<p><i>"My limitations would definitely include time-management and organisation. I tend to underestimate how long I’m going to need to do something. I tend to jump to saying “I can do this in 20 minutes”, whereas I should be saying “I could push myself to do this in 20 minutes, assuming I was fully rested, fed and caffeinated, had no distractions and all processes involved went swimmingly every step of the way, but life happens and I don’t want to stress myself out so it’s going to take an hour.”"</i></p>
<p>These are definitely still limitations of mine. The time-boxing has helped but I still tend to go over the time-box allocations if I get stuck. I havn't reached out when I've been stuck during foundations, I definitely will be doing this during the bootcamp, I think I will find this easier in person.</p>
<h6>
What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
</h6>
<p>I am apprehensive about the pair-programming and the group projects. At times I find it draining to work closely with others, I enjoy it but it takes a lot more energy for me than working alone.</p>
Speaking in front of the group will probably be difficult at least at first, but once I get to know people it should be ok.
<h6>
What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
</h6>
<p>
I would like to develope my time-management and organisational skills as well as my ability to work in groups.
</p>
<h6>
What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
</h6>
<p>I expect that I will put my best effort into everything that I do. I will do everything I can outside of the bootcamp to facilitate me putting my best into the bootcamp. 
  I will keep up with my excercise routines and prioritise sleeping and eating well. 
  I will let myself take the less stressful option in some things e.g. I will take an Uber if it will be less stressful than taking public transport in certain situations, I will have groceries delivered if it will be easier than going to the supermarket, I will buy two of something to give myself peace of mind that I won't run out, things that I usually would try to minimise but right now I will let myself have.</p>
