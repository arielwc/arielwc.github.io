    <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
    
    <p>
        Functions are blocks of code that can be invoked or “called” whenever they are needed. This means that everytime you want your programme to run a particular process, you don’t have to write out every step. I will use an analogy of the magic used in the Harry Potter stories. A function is like a spell, you first need to learn the spell (or create the function) but once you’ve learnt it (or created it), this spell (or function) can be used an infinite number of times and applied whenever it is needed by invoking (or calling) it.</p>
    <p>   
        In Javascript, to create a function you start with the ‘function’ keyword, followed by the name of your function, followed by the a pair of rounded brackets (these can contain parameters if the function requires them) followed by a pair of curly brackets in which you write the function code which is what you want the function to actually do. To call the function, you use the function name followed by a pair of rounded brackets (with parameters if required).</p>
    <p>   
        Parameters are specific pieces of data that you want your function to work with. Some functions have parameters and some do not. This is much like in Harry Potter too, some spells need to be applied directly to a specific target and this is part of the incantation. For example the Accio spell (a charm that summons a target object to the person who calls it) the caller needs to say the spell followed by the target object, e.g Accio broom! In this case, ‘Accio’ would be the function and ‘broom’ would be the parameter. </p>

        We can actually write out an accio function like this: </p>
