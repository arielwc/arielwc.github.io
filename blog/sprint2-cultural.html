    <h2>Sprint 2 Reflections</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I want to be doing something where I am always learning and growing, something where I am solving problems and using my brain. I also want to feel like I am contributing to the world in a useful and meaningful way. Programming seems like a way I can do this. 
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>
                Time-management, energy management, focus management. Update: Since reading more about emotional intelligence, this might be a thing too.
            </p>

        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p>
                My strengths lie in analysis, problem-solving, articulating and processing. I can think about the big picture and get lost in fine details, doing these things simultaneously can be difficult though. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My limitations would definitely include time-management and organisation. I tend to underestimate how long I’m going to need to do something. I tend to jump to saying “I can do this in 20 minutes”, whereas I should be saying “I could push myself to do this in 20 minutes, assuming I was fully rested, fed and caffeinated, had no distractions and all processes involved went swimmingly every step of the way, but life happens and I don’t want to stress myself out so it’s going to take an hour.”
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h1>
            <p>
                When it comes to the bootcamp, I shouldn’t have any problems staying on track, I won’t be working and I will be able to completely focus on the course and nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                During Foundations, this won’t be so easy. As I will be in my family home due to the lockdown, which can be quite noisy and distracting. I am glad that I am here for the lockdown, but it does make studying a bit harder especially as I am also working from home part-time (20 hours per week). I am grateful that I still have employment at this time, but it means that I will need to be disciplined and make sure I stay on task and get things done when I am meant to.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p>
                If I have any issues, once I have tried to help myself and googled thoroughly I will reach out to my facilitator.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>
                I expect that the facilitation team explain their expectations clearly.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>
                In Foundations, I will be working for home for about 20 hours per week. I don’t have set times for this, so I can fit my work commitments and my Foundations work around each other. I have a weekly work meeting on Monday from 9-10am.
