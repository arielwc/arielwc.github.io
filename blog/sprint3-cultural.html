    <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognise and manage your own emotions as well as the ability to sense and respond appropriately and empathetically to the emotional states of others. It draws on a range of skills and is something that is learnt and enhanced through self-development. Emotional Intelligence, as a term, was popularised by the 1995 book Emotional Intelligence by psychologist and scientific journalist Daniel Goleman. But intelligence researchers have been looking at the “non-intellective” aspects of intelligence for much longer, with some studies dating back to the late 1930s. </p>
    <p>The IQ (intelligence quotient) on the other hand relates to the cognitive aspects of intelligence and refers to a score which is derived through standardised testing of information processing, logical reasoning, language and numerical ability as well as spatial and abstract thinking. IQ is supposed to be an objective measure of cognitive and learning abilities. Although someone’s IQ does not necessarily have any bearing on their Emotional Intelligence or vice versa, there has actually been research suggesting that emotional and social competencies can in fact help improve cognitive functioning.

    <p>Emotional Intelligence is important in terms of self-management in both personal and professional spheres. Today’s work environments can be very changeable and the need to be adaptable and able to respond to change is very important, these are emotional and social competencies which draw on emotional intelligence. It is particularly important when it comes to working in teams, the ability to recognise and manage your own emotions and be empathetic towards others when working in a team is vital. On the flipside of this, Emotional Intelligence also plays a huge role when working alone. Working alone requires competencies such as the ability to motivate yourself, hold yourself accountable and monitor and manage your mental and emotional well-being. This has been highlighted recently as the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many people have had to transition to working remotely.
